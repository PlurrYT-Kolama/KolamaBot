# KolamaBot
### Release: v0.3
## A very useful bot for Kolama.Net, making moderation easy to configure and got some extra futures that we need
## License: https://github.com/PlurrYT-Kolama/KolamaBot/blob/main/LICENSE.txt

### Fun fact: we store node_modules due we run code without installing any stuff on server and due our repository contains legacy npm packages what were heavily src edited to work fine :) 

## How to install?
firstly be sure you use this for personal / private project for your friends
Just clone repo and install node.js v21.x with npm
Run node main.js or node . | **dont run npm i**
Please note that you will need to edit code and mention all changes what you made and do credits
credits must contain link to license and contributors.
After that you must edit .env by adding `token=bottoken`
After .env edit config.json fully! Any non edited parameter can cause issues!
you can choose to toggle debug mode as it's on by default
Debug mode doesn't spam or so it just notifies about non critical errors that happened while loading a command
**PLEASE DONT CHANGE ANY FILE LISTED IN LICENSE! 
ALSO PLACE BOT IN A SPERATE FOLDER THAT IS AWAY FROM ANY OTHER FILES LIKE PERSONAL PHOTOS OR OTHER CODES!
IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YOUR DATA MIGHT GET SUSPECTED OR OUR API WILL FALSE DETECT YOUR BOT IN BANNED LIST!**


## How to edit code?
Simply make any changes you want to do, We recommand using node 21 or greater with discord.js v14, then simply just send a pull request with a quick description of what you did, any new additions and npm modules or different tools etc!

## Note

This is the official Kolama.Net Bot source code!
This botis strictly for personal usage, DO NOT USE IT IN A PUBLIC BOT, don't forget to include credits aka follow license
Hopefully you will like this code we were working hard for it
